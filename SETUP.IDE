Copy GL, GLM and SDL to project root folder.
Then add the headers to the additional libraries directories.
Then add the compiled libraries to the linker additional dependencies.

Add this to directories:
	.\GL;.\GLM;.\SDL;.\bin

And this to linker libraries (notice, opengl32 comes from the system libraries!):
	;glew32.lib;glew32s.lib;SDL2.lib;SDL2main.lib;SDL2test.lib;opengl32.lib
